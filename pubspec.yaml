# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/ # Kept as your original (includes app_logo.png)
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,

# ADDED flutter_launcher_icons configuration block
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon" # This is the default name for Android launcher icons
  ios: true                # This will generate iOS icons
  image_path: "assets/images/app_logo.png" # Path to your high-resolution master icon
  min_sdk_android: 21      # Optional: For adaptive icons on Android Oreo and above.
  # remove_alpha_ios: true  # Optional: Set to true if your master icon has transparency and you want a solid background for the iOS icon.

  # --- Optional: For more control over Android Adaptive Icons ---
  # If your "assets/images/app_logo.png" is just the foreground element (e.g., your cross on a transparent background)
  # then specify a background color or image for adaptive icons.
  # If your "assets/images/app_logo.png" already includes its own suitable square/squircle background,
  # you might not need these `adaptive_icon_` settings, but testing is key.
  #
  # adaptive_icon_background: "#2E7D32" # Example: Your app's dark green color as hex
  # adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/app_logo_foreground.png" # Path to a foreground-only version of your logo
  #
  # If your app_logo.png (the one at image_path) already has a solid background and is square-ish,
  # the package will attempt to use it for both foreground and background of the adaptive icon.
  # Check how it looks on Android 8.0+ devices/emulators.
